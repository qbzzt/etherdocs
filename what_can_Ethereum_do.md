# What Can Ethereum Do?
### Ori Pomerantz qbzzt1@gmail.com 

In this essay I am going to attempt to explain [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) and why I think the general concept 
(blockchain verified computer programs) is going to be incredibly important for our economic future.

**Note:** If you prefer, you can [watch a presentation](https://youtu.be/ZL9YtKlb8Vk).

## Background: The Value of Trust

The basis of our economic system is trust. My employer trusts that even though I work from home with minimal supervision,
the work I'm assigned will get done. I trust that they'll deposit the agreed upon salary into my bank account, and that the
bank will not "disappear" that money. When I go to Target to buy food, I trust that the food is what the package promises. 
Target trusts me not to claim my debit card was stolen and attempt to reverse the charges, and the bank to transfer the correct
amount of money from my account to Target's.

Over time we evolved many mechanisms to verify and enforce this trust such as credit reports, regulatory bodies, and 
the courts. Blockchain is essentially another such mechanism, one that works in a distributed fashion without a central 
authority.


## Trust and Computer Protocols

Computer protocols work by transferring messages. Messages can be authenticated as having come from a specific identity,
a combination of a private key used to sign messages and a public key that is used to authenticate them. This is how you 
know, for example, that when connect to your bank's website for online banking you are connected to the correct site and not 
a fake. The login form is signed by the bank's private key, and your browser uses the bank's public key to verify that 
signature. The certificates you may have heard about are another level of this process, with a certificate authority
using its private key to sign that a particular public key does indeed match that bank's private key.

### Bad Checks and Double Spending

Unfortunately, protocols that use this process are still vulnerabe to some forms of abuse. Here is a very simple one:

1. I get a signed message from the bank saying I have $10 on deposit.
1. I give Alice a signed message stating that:
   - I have $10, as proved by the bank's message which I attach
   - I give her $7 from my deposit
1. In return for services rendered, I give you a signed message stating that:
   - I have $10, as proved by the bank's message which I attach
   - I give you $5 from my deposit
1. Alice's message gets to the bank first. They see that I signed a legitimate transfer and give Alice the $7.
1. When your message gets to the bank, the bank doesn't have the promised money in the account anymore and you can't get it.

This is the same as if I had given Alice a check for $7 and you a check for $5 drawn on the same bank account that only
has a balance of $10. Physical banks require proof of identity before they open a bank account, so it is well known
who passed the bad checks and they can be punished for it. However, in the digital world it is easy to create an extra
identity ([see here for instructions on how to create a new Ethereum identity to see how easy it 
is](https://github.com/qbzzt/etherdocs/blob/master/paper_wallet.md)) and therefore people can have as many 
throw away "identities" as they want.

This is called [the double spending problem](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/doublespending.asp). I have two dollars 
that I spent twice, once with Alice and once with you. The basic vulnerability is the private nature of the messages.
If you had known I had already given Alice $7, you'd know I only had $3 and wouldn't trust me when I said I have $5 to pay
you. This is the problem that blockchains solve.


### Public Messages and Blockchains

There is a very simple solution to the double spending problem. Send all money transfer messages to a central repository,
and only count the money as having been transfered after the central repository approves that money transfer. This is what 
we do with bank accounts when we use debit cards. We tell the bank "pay $x to Y", and wait for an acknowledgement
that the transfer took place. This solves the double spending problem, because the central authority knows exactly how much 
each identity has at any point.

The problem is that this process requires complete trust in the central authority. As a society we currently use a
[long and expensive licensing process](https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/banking_12779.htm) to establish this trust, and
[regular complex
audits](https://www.occ.gov/publications-and-resources/publications/comptrollers-handbook/files/internal-external-audits/pub-ch-audits.pdf) 
to maintain it.

Blockchains deal with the trust problem in a different way. Instead of private messages (for example, between you
and the bank), messages are broadcast and tied together in a way that makes it extremely difficult to remove or
modify one of them without invalidating subsequent messages. This means that anybody who relies on subsequent messages
on the blockchain has a vested interest in preserving your message accurately. This has several important effects:

* Instead of trusting a single central authority, you trust that the majority of the blockchain's nodes are honest. 
  As I am writing this [there are over 7000 Ethereum nodes](https://www.ethernodes.org/). Subverting enough nodes to 
  subvert the entire network would be a very difficult task.
* There is no point subverting a small number of nodes, so the likelihood of attack on any specific node, and 
  therefore the effort required to secure it, is a lot smaller. This makes it a lot easier to run nodes, which 
  increases their number and further decreases the value of subverting any individual node.
  

## Ethereum

Ethereum takes the blockchain concept a level further by allowing whole contracts to be written in a computer language 
and executed in a manner that anybody can verify on a blockchain. This means they are public and deterministic. Anybody can 
read the contract's current state and check what it will enforce in the future given various inputs. Removing ambiguity 
in this manner removes some of the causes for expensive and inefficient litigation.

For example, take a secured loan. It has these elements:

* The lender gives the borrower a certain amount (the principal)
* There is a mutually agreed upon repayment schedule 
* The borrower is supposed to pay back in accordance with the schedule
* Borrowers who are delinquent can get back into compliance by paying what they owe plus a penalty,
  calculated by a mutually agreed formula
* At a certain (preagreed) point the delinquency becomes a default, and the collateral becomes the property of
  the lender
* Changes to the payment schedule require the approval of both sides

Because human language is always subject to interpretation, a borrower can use litigation to postpone the loss of the 
collateral. Also, both sides are required to keep records of payments to make sure the other side isn't cheating. This 
friction makes lending more risky and borrowing more expensive.

Using Ethereum it is possible to create a public loan contract (in Ethereum the word contract is used for an independent
piece of software that runs on the blockchain). Title to the collateral can be represented by a 
[non-fungible token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token). The Ethereum contract can handle almost all 
the details:

1. The lender sends a message to the contract with:
   - The identity of the borrower
   - The principal (in the form of a cryptocurrency)
   - The mutually agreed upon terms:
     - Repayment schedule
     - Delinquency penalty formula
     - Definition of when a delinquency becomes a default
1. The borrower sends a message to the contract with:
    - The identity of the lender
    - The token representing the collateral
    - The mutually agreed upon terms (same list as above)
1. The contract verifies that the terms agreed upon really are identical, and then sends the principal to the 
   borrower. If there are no agreed upon terms, the contract sends the lender back the money and the borrower
   back the title for the collateral.
1. The borrower makes payments to the contract, which the contract then sends to the lender. This way, the
   contract can monitor compliance with the repayment schedule.
1. If the borrower is delinquent, the contract adjusts the payment schedule accordingly (adding the penalty
   function). At any point the borrower can query the contract to get the updated payment schedule and the
   payment history.
1. If the borrower is in default, the lender can ask the contract for the collateral, which is then transferred
   to the lender.
   
It is also possible for the lender, the borrower, or a third party to periodically activate the contract to send 
payment reminders to borrowers.
    
The only case in which courts would need to be involved is if the borrower, having lost the title to the collateral,
insists on keeping it. And in that case it would be an extremely simple case as long as the borrower signed a contract
accepting that whoever owns the non fungible token owns the collateral. All the other facts that easy to prove from
the blockchain.


## Conclusion

Ethereum is not panacea, it cannot physically change who has possession of physical assets or deal with unanticipated
circumstances. However, in an economy as complex as ours, it can provide a cheap and easy source of trust and sometimes
replace time consuming and costly litigation.
